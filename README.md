What I have learned
[Tell more about what you have learned while building this project]

Example:

While I was building {YOUR_PROJECT_NAME} I learned the fundamentals of React and Redux. I learned the difference between React Context API and Redux, and what works best for my current application. I have used Reat hooks like useEffect, and useState. It was my first project using TypeScript and I have learned a lot about TypeScript type definitions and fundamentals.

What issues have I faced and how have I resolved them
[Tell what was hard in the process of building the project. Tell me about where have you felt stuck and how you overcame this.]

Example:

When I tried to connect to the third-party API, I was not sure how to use fetch what is the difference between async/await, what are Promises, and how to use them. After some Googling I found out the MDN documentation about async/await and tried to use it in practice - it worked!
